# flac-convert-gui
A tkinter GUIi used to batch "down"-convert 24bit flac files to 16 bit flac or mp3
This small script was developed specifically for use with the Rockbox OS installed on a classic IPOD.

The current (2025) mods for a classic iPod allow for an increased flash based drive. The IFLASH Quad upgrade board allows the user to replace the internal hard drive with 4 micro-sd cards. The IFLASH card allows extra room in the iPod case allowing for a much larger than stock battery. These basic upgrades coupled with installation of the ROCK-BOX OS make for an incredible digital audio player.

Unfortunately, limitations on the IPOD chip-set do not allow Rockbox to read 24 bit flac and hi-res audio files . This gui allows for the user to point to any folder (in a mounted ipod or on a computer) and check for 24 bit files and convert them to 16 bit. saved in a new folder or delete the original files and replace them with 16 bit files.

User can also select MP3 as an option instead of FLAC as a file format to convert to.

This is a pretty specific use case. There are hundreds of audio conversion tools out there. This one was written specifically to solve the problem of 24 bit files in the Rock-boxed IPOD
